Imagine you're a LEGO brick physicist at the prestigious Plastic University, tasked with explaining how black holes, quantum entanglement, and cosmic inflation would work in a universe made entirely of LEGO bricks. Please include at least one joke about why LEGO astronauts never float away (those studs really hold them down!) and explain how the quantum tunneling of a 2x4 brick through a 2x2 baseplate might violate the fundamental laws of both physics and LEGO building instructions.
