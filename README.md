  --topic "Compose a new symphony" \
  --auto

# Educational Discussions
chatty --with "Einstein,Feynman,Bohr" \
  --topic "Quantum mechanics explained simply" \
  --auto

# Philosophical Debates
chatty --with "Socrates,Nietzsche,Sartre" \
  --topic "Purpose of existence" \
  --turns 12 \
  --auto
```

Tips for autonomous mode:

- Use clear, focused topics

### üìù Chat History Management

Chatty maintains separate chat histories for each agent:

```bash

~/.chatty/chat_history_<agent_name>.json

# Examples:
~/.chatty/chat_history_einstein.json
~/.chatty/chat_history_ada.json
```

Managing histories:

```bash
# Clear specific agent's history
chatty --clear "Einstein"

# Clear all chat histories
chatty --clear all
```

History files are JSON formatted and include:

- System messages
- User messages
- Agent responses
- Timestamps
- Conversation metadata

### üìù Configuration

Your settings live in `~/.chatty/config.json`. Chatty is highly customizable through this configuration file. For a reference example, see the [config.sample.json](config.sample.json) file included in the repository.

You can customize:

- **Default Agent**: Set your preferred AI personality as the default
- **Language Preferences**: Choose your preferred language for interactions
- **Model Settings**: Configure which AI model to use (e.g., llama3.2)
- **System Directives**: Fine-tune how agents behave with custom guidelines:
  - `base_guidelines`: General behavior instructions for all agents
  - `interactive_guidelines`: How agents behave in direct conversations
  - `autonomous_guidelines`: How agents behave in autonomous mode

To modify your configuration:

```bash
# Edit configuration manually
nano ~/.chatty/config.json
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common solutions:

```bash
# Initialization issues
chatty init               # First-time setup or reset

# Connection problems
ollama serve              # Ensure Ollama is running
chatty --with "Agent Name" --debug # Show debug information

# Fresh start
rm -rf ~/.chatty          # Remove all settings
chatty init               # Reinitialize
```
