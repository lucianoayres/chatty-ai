## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Ollama installed and running locally
- The `llama3.2` model installed in Ollama

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd chatty
```

2. Make sure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

3. Install the llama3.2 model if you haven't already:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

4. Build the application:

```bash
# Using go build
go build -o bin/chatty cmd/chatty/main.go

# Or using the provided task file
task build
```

## Usage

### Basic Chat

You can send messages in two ways:

1. Without quotes (for simple messages):

```bash
./bin/chatty How are you doing today?
```

2. With quotes (required for messages containing special characters):

```bash
./bin/chatty "What's the meaning of life?"
```

### Special Commands

```bash
# Clear conversation history
./bin/chatty --clear              # Clear all histories
./bin/chatty --clear rocket      # Clear specific assistant's history

# List available assistants
./bin/chatty --list

# Switch to a different assistant
./bin/chatty --select nova

# Show current assistant
./bin/chatty --current
```

## Chat History

Each assistant maintains their own chat history in `~/.chatty/`:

- Files are named `chat_history_<assistant>.json`
- Histories include:
  - System message that sets the AI's behavior
  - All user messages and AI responses
  - Context preservation between conversations
- Histories are automatically created on first use
- Each assistant maintains independent conversation context

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Create a development build
task build

# Install to system
task install

# Run tests
task test

# Clean build artifacts
task clean
```

### Adding Features

1. Create new assistant YAML files in `builtin/` if needed
2. Implement new features in `main.go` or `assistants.go`
3. Follow the existing code structure and patterns

## Error Handling

The program handles various error cases:

- Invalid command usage
- Ollama server connection issues
- File system errors
- JSON parsing errors
- Invalid assistant selection

## Notes

- The chat history is maintained between sessions
- The AI maintains context of previous conversations
- Responses are streamed in real-time as they're generated
- Assistant personalities can be switched at any time
- The API endpoint can be changed to connect to remote Ollama instances
- Each assistant maintains their unique personality and style
